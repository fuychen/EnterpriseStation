        <div class="aboutus-txt1">The story can be traced back to 10 years ago when Niki Wang (co-founder of PZ Interculture) took part in an English summer camp to Australia. That two-week summer camp left a great impact on her life and made her realize that study tour is a perfect way to meet different people and cultures.</div>
        <div class="aboutus-txt1">Bearing that in mind, Niki went to the United States to pursue her study. For over 6 years in school, Niki has devoted herself in promoting cultural communication between students of China and America whether as a language partner or the chairman of student union.</div>
        <div class="aboutus-txt1">After graduating from the University of Maryland, she came back to homeland and set out to make preparations for her first culture project wholeheartedly. Gradually, like-minded fellows joined in. Most of them have experiences of studying abroad. Throughout continuous efforts, 2017 PZ “A Bite of Beijing” study tour was born. This study tour, which you may attend, not only condensed Niki’s greatest enthusiasm for both Oriental and Western Culture, but also embodied our team’s biggest effort as well as wisdom.</div>
        <div class="aboutus-txt1">It is our expectation that you will know the real China after participating in our program. When the charm of Orient sparks in your eyes, the dream of our eternal pursuit comes true.</div>
